## Features
- Add new snippets, edit snippets, or delete snippets on the fly.
- Syntax highlighting while you edit the snippet. Includes highlighting of
  tabstops and placeholders such as `$0`, `${2:foobar}`, or `$CLIPBOARD`
- Automagical conversion from buffer text to JSON string.
- Intuitive UI for editing the snippet, dynamically adapting the number of
  prefixes.
- Automatic hot-reloading of any changes, so you do not have to restart nvim for
  changes to take effect.
- Optional JSON-formatting and sorting of the snippet file. ([Useful when
  version-controlling your snippet
  collection](#version-controlling-snippets--snippet-file-formatting).)
- Snippet/file selection via `telescope`, `snacks`, or `vim.ui.select`.
- Automatic bootstrapping of the snippet folder or new snippet files if needed.
- Supports only [VSCode-style
  snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets).

> [!TIP]
> You can use
> [snippet-converter.nvim](https://github.com/smjonas/snippet-converter.nvim) to
> convert your snippets to the VSCode format.

## Rationale
- The [VSCode snippet
  format](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) is the
  closest thing to a standard regarding snippets. It is used by
  [friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets) and
  supported by most snippet engine plugins for nvim.
- However, VSCode snippets are stored as JSON, which are a pain to modify
  manually. This plugin alleviates that pain by automagically writing the JSON
  for you.

## Requirements
- nvim 0.10+
- Snippets saved in the [VSCode-style snippet
  format](#introduction-to-the-vscode-style-snippet-format).
- [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) or 
[snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim) OR
  ([dressing.nvim](http://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim) AND
  [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua)).
  * Note that snippet previews only work when using `telescope` or `snacks`.
- A snippet engine that can load VSCode-style snippets, such as:
  * [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip)
  * [mini.snippets](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-snippets.md)
  * [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp)
  * [basics-language-server](https://github.com/antonk52/basics-language-server/)
  * [nvim-snippets](https://github.com/garymjr/nvim-snippets)
  * [vim-vsnip](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vim-vsnip)
- *Optional*: Treesitter parsers for the languages you want syntax highlighting
  for.

## Installation

### nvim-scissors

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-scissors",
	dependencies = "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- if using telescope
	opts = {
		snippetDir = "path/to/your/snippetFolder",
	} 
},

-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-scissors",
	dependencies = "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- if using telescope
	config = function()
		require("scissors").setup ({
			snippetDir = "path/to/your/snippetFolder",
		})
	end,
}
```

### Snippet engine setup
In addition, your snippet engine needs to point to the same snippet folder as
`nvim-scissors`:

> [!TIP]
> `vim.fn.stdpath("config")` returns the path to your nvim config.

#### LuaSnip

```lua
require("luasnip.loaders.from_vscode").lazy_load {
	paths = { "path/to/your/snippetFolder" },
}
```

<!-- LTeX: enabled=false -->
#### mini.snippets
<!-- LTeX: enabled=true -->
`mini.snippets` preferred snippet location is any `snippets/` directory in the
`runtimepath`. For manually maintained snippets the best location is the user
config directory, which requires the following `nvim-scissors` setup:

```lua
require("scissors").setup({
	snippetDir = vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/snippets",
})
```

The `mini.snippets` setup requires explicit definition of loaders. Following its
[Quickstart](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-snippets.md#quickstart)
guide should be enough to make it respect snippets from 'snippets/' directory
inside user config. **Note**: `nvim-scissors` works only with VSCode-style
snippet files (not Lua files or JSON arrays), and also requires a
[`package.json` for the VSCode
format](#introduction-to-the-vscode-style-snippet-format).

<!-- LTeX: enabled=false -->
#### blink.cmp
<!-- LTeX: enabled=true -->

```lua
require("blink.cmp").setup {
	sources = {
		providers = {
			snippets = {
				opts = {
					search_paths = { "path/to/your/snippetFolder" },
				},
			}
		}
	}
}
```

It is recommended to use the latest release of `blink.cmp` for hot-reloading to
work.

<!-- LTeX: enabled=false -->
#### basics-language-server
<!-- LTeX: enabled=true -->

```lua
-- NOTE: this requires `nvim-lspconfig` as additional dependency
require("lspconfig").basics_ls.setup({
    settings = {
        snippet = {
            enable = true,
            sources = { "path/to/your/snippetFolder" }
        },
    }
})
```

Note that hot-reloading of the new/edited snippet for `basics_ls` also requires
`nvim-lspconfig`.

<!-- LTeX: enabled=false -->
#### nvim-snippets
<!-- LTeX: enabled=true -->

```lua
require("nvim-snippets").setup {
	search_paths = { "path/to/your/snippetFolder" },
}
```

<!-- LTeX: enabled=false -->
#### vim-vsnip
<!-- LTeX: enabled=true -->

```lua
vim.g.vsnip_snippet_dir = "path/to/your/snippetFolder"
-- OR
vim.g.vsnip_snippet_dirs = { "path/to/your/snippetFolder" }
```

## Usage

### Starting `nvim-scissors`
The plugin provides two lua functions, `.addNewSnippet()` and `.editSnippet()`:

```lua
vim.keymap.set(
	"n",
	"<leader>se",
	function() require("scissors").editSnippet() end,
	{ desc = "Snippet: Edit" }
)

-- when used in visual mode, prefills the selection as snippet body
vim.keymap.set(
	{ "n", "x" },
	"<leader>sa",
	function() require("scissors").addNewSnippet() end,
	{ desc = "Snippet: Add" }
)
```

You can also use `:ScissorsAddNewSnippet` and `:ScissorsEditSnippet` if you
prefer ex commands.

The `:ScissorsAddSnippet` ex command also accepts a range to prefill the snippet
body (for example `:'<,'> ScissorsAddSnippet` or `:3 ScissorsAddSnippet`).

### Editing snippets in the popup window
The popup is just one window, so you can move between the prefix area and the
body with `j` and `k` or any other movement command. ("Prefix" is how trigger
words are referred to in the VSCode format.)

Use `showHelp` (default keymap: `?`) to show a notification containing all
keymaps.

The popup intelligently adapts to changes in the prefix area: Each line
represents one prefix, and creating or removing lines in that area thus changes
the number of prefixes.

## Configuration
The `.setup()` call is optional.

```lua
-- default settings
require("scissors").setup {
	snippetDir = vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/snippets",
	editSnippetPopup = {
		height = 0.4, -- relative to the window, between 0-1
		width = 0.6,
		border = "rounded",
		keymaps = {
			-- if not mentioned otherwise, the keymaps apply to normal mode
			cancel = "q",
			saveChanges = "<CR>", -- alternatively, can also use `:w`
			goBackToSearch = "<BS>",
			deleteSnippet = "<C-BS>",
			duplicateSnippet = "<C-d>",
			openInFile = "<C-o>",
			insertNextPlaceholder = "<C-p>", -- insert & normal mode
			showHelp = "?",
		},
	},
	telescope = {
		-- By default, the query only searches snippet prefixes. Set this to
		-- `true` to also search the body of the snippets.
		alsoSearchSnippetBody = false,

		-- accepts the common telescope picker config
		opts = {
			layout_strategy = "horizontal",
			layout_config = {
				horizontal = { width = 0.9 },
				preview_width = 0.6,
			},
		},
	},

	-- `none` writes as a minified json file using `vim.encode.json`.
	-- `yq`/`jq` ensure formatted & sorted json files, which is relevant when
	-- you version control your snippets. To use a custom formatter, set to a
	-- list of strings, which will then be passed to `vim.system()`.
	---@type "yq"|"jq"|"none"|string[]
	jsonFormatter = "none",

	backdrop = {
		enabled = true,
		blend = 50, -- between 0-100
	},
	icons = {
		scissors = "󰩫",
	},
}
```

> Note that you can configure the `snacks` picker through `snacks.nvim`'s
picker configuration. See the
[snacks docs](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/docs/picker.md)
for more information.

## Cookbook & FAQ

### Introduction to the VSCode-style snippet format
This plugin requires that you have a valid VSCode snippet folder. In addition to
saving the snippets in the required JSON format, there must also be a
`package.json` file at the root of the snippet folder, specifying which files
should be used for which languages.

Example file structure inside the `snippetDir`:

```txt
.
├── package.json
├── python.json
├── project-specific
│   └── nvim-lua.json
├── javascript.json
└── allFiletypes.json
```

Example `package.json`:

```json
{
	"contributes": {
		"snippets": [
			{
				"language": "python",
				"path": "./python.json"
			},
			{
				"language": "lua",
				"path": "./project-specific/nvim-lua.json"
			},
			{
				"language": ["javascript", "typescript"],
				"path": "./javascript.json"
			},
			{
				"language": "all",
				"path": "./allFiletypes.json"
			}
		]
	},
	"name": "my-snippets"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The special filetype `all` enables the snippets globally, regardless of
> filetype.

Example snippet file (here: `nvim-lua.json`):

```json
{
  "autocmd (Filetype)": {
    "body": [
      "vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"FileType\", {",
      "\tpattern = \"${1:ft}\",",
      "\tcallback = function()",
      "\t\t$0",
      "\tend,",
      "})"
    ],
    "prefix": "autocmd (Filetype)"
  },
  "file exists": {
    "body": "local fileExists = vim.uv.fs_stat(\"${1:filepath}\") ~= nil",
    "prefix": "file exists"
  },
}
```

For details, read the official VSCode snippet documentation:
- [Snippet file specification](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)
- [`package.json` specification](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/snippet-guide)
- [LuaSnip-specific additions to the format](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#vs-code)

### Tabstops and variables
[Tabstops](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_tabstops)
are denoted by `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc., with `$0` being the last tabstop. They
support placeholders such as `${1:foobar}`.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the use of `$` in the snippet syntax, any *literal* `$` needs to be
> escaped as `\$`.

Furthermore, there are various variables you can use, such as `$TM_FILENAME` or
`$LINE_COMMENT`. [See here for a full list of
variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables).

<!-- LTeX: enabled=false -->
### friendly-snippets
<!-- LTeX: enabled=true -->
Even though the snippets from the [friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets)
repository are written in the VSCode-style format, editing them directly is not
supported. The reason being that any changes made would be overwritten as soon
as the `friendly-snippets` repository is updated (which happens fairly
regularly). Unfortunately, there is little `nvim-scissors` can do about that.

What you can do, however, is to copy individual snippets files from the
`friendly-snippets` repository into your own snippet folder, and edit them there.

### Edit snippet title or description
`nvim-scissors` only allows to edit the snippet prefix and snippet body, to keep
the UI as simple as possible. For the few cases where you need to edit a
snippet's title or description, you can use the `openInFile` keymap and edit
them directly in the snippet file.

### Version controlling snippets & snippet file formatting
This plugin writes JSON files via `vim.encode.json()`. That method saves
the file in minified form and does not have a
deterministic order of dictionary keys.

Both, minification and unstable key order, are a problem if you
version-control your snippet collection. To solve this issue, `nvim-scissors`
lets you optionally unminify and sort the JSON files via `yq` or `jq` after
updating a snippet. (Both are also available via
[mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim).)

It is recommended to run `yq`/`jq` once on all files in your snippet collection,
since the first time you edit a file, you would still get a large diff from the
initial sorting. You can do so with `yq` using this command:

```bash
cd "/your/snippet/dir"
fd ".*\.json" | xargs -I {} yq --inplace --output-format=json "sort_keys(..)" {}
```

How to do the same with `jq` is left as an exercise to the reader.

### Snippets on visual selections (`Luasnip` only)
With `Luasnip`, this is an opt-in feature, enabled via:

```lua
require("luasnip").setup {
	store_selection_keys = "<Tab>",
}
```

In your VSCode-style snippet, use the token `$TM_SELECTED_TEXT` at the location
where you want the selection to be inserted. (It's roughly the equivalent of
`LS_SELECT_RAW` in the `Luasnip` syntax.)

Then, in visual mode, press the key from `store_selection_keys`. The selection
disappears, and you are put in insert mode. The next snippet you now trigger
is going to have `$TM_SELECTED_TEXT` replaced with your selection.

### Auto-triggered snippets (`Luasnip` only)
While the VSCode snippet format does not support auto-triggered snippets,
`LuaSnip` allows you to [specify auto-triggering in the VSCode-style JSON
files by adding the `luasnip` key](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#vs-code).

`nvim-scissors` does not touch any keys other than `prefix` and `body` in the
JSON files, so any additions like the `luasnip` key are preserved.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the `openInFile` keymap to directory open JSON file at the
> snippet's location to make edits there easier.
