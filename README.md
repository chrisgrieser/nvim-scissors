## Features
- Add new snippets, edit snippets, or delete snippets on the fly.
- Syntax highlighting while you edit the snippet. Includes highlighting of
  tokens like `$0` or `${2:foobar}`.
- Automagical conversion from buffer text to JSON string (quotes are escaped, etc.)
- Intuitive UI for editing the snippet, dynamically adapting the number of
  prefixes.
- Auto-reloading of the new/edited snippet (if using `LuaSnip`).
- JSON-formatting and sorting of the snippet file after updating, using `yq` or
  `jq`. (Optional, but [useful when version-controlling your snippet collection](#version-controlling-snippets-json-formatting).)
- Snippet/file
  selection via `telescope` or `vim.ui.select`.  
- Automatic bootstrapping of the snippet folder, if it is empty or missing a
  `package.json`.
- Supports only [VSCode-style snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets).

> [!TIP]

> [snippet-converter.nvim](https://github.com/smjonas/snippet-converter.nvim) to
> convert your snippets to the VSCode format.

## Rationale
- Regrettably, there are innumerable formats in which snippets can be saved. The
  closest thing to a standard is the [VSCode snippet
  format](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets). For
  portability, easier sharing, and to future-proof your snippet collection, it
  can make sense to save your snippets in that format.
- Most notably, the VSCode format is used by plugins like
  [friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets) and
  supported by [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#vs-code).
- However, the snippets are stored as JSON files, which are a pain to modify
  manually. This plugin aims to alleviate that pain by automagically writing
  the JSON for you.

## Installation
The plugin **requires** that your snippet are saved in the VSCode-style snippet
format. If your snippet folder is empty, this plugin bootstraps a simple
snippet folder for you.

For the specific requirements of the VSCode-style snippets, please see
[the FAQ section on the VSCode format](#example-for-the-vscode-style-snippet-format).

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-scissors",
	dependencies = "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- optional
	opts = {
		snippetDir = "path/to/your/snippetFolder",
	} 
},

-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-scissors",
	dependencies = "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- optional
	config = function()
		require("scissors").setup ({
			snippetDir = "path/to/your/snippetFolder",
		})
	end,
}
```

When [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) is
installed, it is automatically used as picker. Otherwise, `nvim-scissors`
falls back to `vim.ui.select`. (You can use
[dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim) to re-direct
`vim.ui.select` to [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua), if you prefer
it over telescope.)

If you are not using VSCode-style snippets already, here is how you load them
with `LuaSnip`:

```lua
require("luasnip.loaders.from_vscode").lazy_load { paths = { "path/to/your/snippetFolder" } }
```

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin is only for editing and creating snippets.
> It does not *expand* snippets, which is
> done by snippet engines like [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip).

## Usage
The plugin provides two commands, `addNewSnippet` and `editSnippet`. Here is the
code to create keymaps for them:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>se", require("scissors").editSnippet)

-- When used in visual mode prefills the selection as body.
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "x" }, "<leader>sa", require("scissors").addNewSnippet)
```

And here is the code to create user commands:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_user_command('SnippetEdit', require("scissors").editSnippet, {})

-- When used in visual mode (or range is supplied) prefills the selection as body.
vim.api.nvim_create_user_command('SnippetAdd', require("scissors").addNewSnippet, { range = true })
```

> [!TIP]
> A quick method for creating a new snippet that is similar to an existing
> snippet is to search for a snippet via `editSnippet`, and then use the
> `duplicateSnippet` command (default keymap: `<C-d>`). 

The popup intelligently adapts to changes in the prefix area: Each line
represents one prefix, and creating or removing lines thus changes
the number of prefixes. ("Prefix" is how trigger words are referred to in the
VSCode format.)

## Configuration
The `.setup()` call is optional.

```lua
-- default settings
require("scissors").setup {
	snippetDir = vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/snippets",
	editSnippetPopup = {
		height = 0.4, -- relative to the window, number between 0 and 1
		width = 0.6,
		border = "rounded",
		keymaps = {
			cancel = "q",
			saveChanges = "<CR>", -- alternatively, can also use `:w`
			goBackToSearch = "<BS>",
			deleteSnippet = "<C-BS>",
			duplicateSnippet = "<C-d>",
			openInFile = "<C-o>",
			insertNextToken = "<C-t>", -- insert & normal mode
			jumpBetweenBodyAndPrefix = "<C-Tab>", -- insert & normal mode
		},
	},
	telescope = {
		-- By default, the query only searches snippet prefixes. Set this to
		-- `true` to also search the body of the snippets.
		alsoSearchSnippetBody = false,
	},
	-- `none` writes as a minified json file using `vim.encode.json`.
	-- `yq`/`jq` ensure formatted & sorted json files, which is relevant when
	-- you version control your snippets.
	jsonFormatter = "none", -- "yq"|"jq"|"none"
}
```

> [!TIP]
> `vim.fn.stdpath("config")` returns the path to your nvim config.

## Cookbook & FAQ

### Example for the VSCode-style snippet format
This plugin requires that you have a valid VSCode snippet folder. In addition to
saving the snippets in the required JSON format, there must also be a
`package.json` at the root of the snippet folder, specifying which files are
should be used for which languages.

Example file structure inside the `snippetDir`:

```txt
.
├── package.json
├── python.json
├── project-specific
│   └── nvim-lua.json
├── javascript.json
└── allFiletypes.json
```

Example `package.json`:

```json
{
	"contributes": {
		"snippets": [
			{
				"language": "python",
				"path": "./python.json"
			},
			{
				"language": "lua",
				"path": "./project-specific/nvim-lua.json"
			},
			{
				"language": ["javascript", "typescript"],
				"path": "./javascript.json"
			},
			{
				"language": "all",
				"path": "./allFiletypes.json"
			}
		]
	},
	"name": "my-snippets"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The special filetype `all` enables the snippets globally, regardless of
> filetype.

Example snippet file (here: `nvim-lua.json`):

```json
{
  "autocmd (Filetype)": {
    "body": [
      "vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"FileType\", {",
      "\tpattern = \"${1:ft}\",",
      "\tcallback = function()",
      "\t\t$0",
      "\tend,",
      "})"
    ],
    "prefix": "autocmd (Filetype)"
  },
  "file exists": {
    "body": "local fileExists = vim.loop.fs_stat(\"${1:filepath}\") ~= nil",
    "prefix": "file exists"
  },
}
```

For details, read the official VSCode snippet documentation:
- [Snippet file specification](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)
- [`package.json` specification](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/snippet-guide)
- [LuaSnip-specific additions to the format](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#vs-code)

### Version Controlling Snippets: JSON-formatting
This plugin writes JSON files via `vim.encode.json`. That method saves
the file in minified form, and does not have a
deterministic order of dictionary keys.

Both, minification, and unstable key order, are of course problem if you
version-control your snippet collection. To solve this problem, `nvim-scissors`
can optionally unminify and sort the JSON files via `yq` or `jq` after updating
a snippet. (Both are also available via
[mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim).)

It is recommended to run `yq`/`jq` once on all files in your snippet
collection, since the first time you edit a file, you would still get a large diff
from the initial sorting. You can do so with `yq` using this command:

```bash
cd "/your/snippet/dir"
fd ".*\.json" | xargs -I {} yq --inplace --output-format=json "sort_keys(..)" {}
```

How to do the same with `jq` is left as an exercise to the reader.

### `friendly-snippets`
Even though the snippets from the [friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets)
repository are written in the VSCode-style format, editing them directly is not
supported. The reason being that any changes made would be overwritten as soon
as the `friendly-snippets` repository is updated (which happens fairly
regularly), and there is little `nvim-scissors` can do about that.

What you can do, however, is to copy individual snippets files from the
`friendly-snippets` repository into your own snippet folder, and edit them then.

### Auto-triggered Snippets
While the VSCode snippet format does not support auto-triggered snippets,
`LuaSnip` allows you to [specify auto-triggering in the VSCode-style JSON
files by adding the `luasnip` key](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#vs-code).

`nvim-scissors` does not touch any keys other than `prefix` and `body` in the
JSON files, so any additions via the `luasnip` key are preserved.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the `openInFile` keymap to directory open JSON file at the
> snippet's location to make edits there easier.
